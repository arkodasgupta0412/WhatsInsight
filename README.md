**WhatsInsight** is an intelligent, advanced, visual analytics tool that extracts meaningful insights from WhatsApp chats. Designed with interactivity and aesthetics in mind, it enables users to explore conversational trends, behavioral patterns, and hidden dynamics in group or personal chats.

## What Does It Do?

WhatsInsight helps you answer:

- Who talks the most in the group?
- What are the most active hours?
- How does activity vary by weekday?
- Are you a day chatter or night owl?
- How fast do people respond?
- Who sends the most media or links?
- What are the dominant words used?

All of these are visualized through bar graphs, donut graphs, pie charts, word clouds, and even chat timelines.
